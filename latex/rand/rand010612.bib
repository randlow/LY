	abstract = {We examine how the use of high-frequency data impacts the portfolio optimization decision. Prior research has documented that an estimate of realized volatility is more precise when based upon intraday returns rather than daily returns. Using the framework of a professional investment manager who wishes to track the S\&P 500 with the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, we find that the benefits of using high-frequency data depend upon the rebalancing frequency and estimation horizon. If the portfolio is rebalanced monthly and the manager has access to at least the previous 12 months of data, daily data have the potential to perform as well as high-frequency data. However, substantial improvements in the portfolio optimization decision from high-frequency data are realized if the manager rebalances daily or has less than a 6-month estimation window. These findings are robust to transaction costs. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}This} article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary bootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators and constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly dependent stationary observations. Previously, a technique based on resampling blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to construct confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional joint distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed. This procedure has been generalized by constructing a "blocks of blocks" resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures even for a multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional) joint distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These methods share the construction of resampling blocks of observations to form a pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may be recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context of applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require the resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on the original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures lack this property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed stationary and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary procedure is based on resampling blocks of random length, where the length of each block has a geometric distribution. In this article, fundamental consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary resampling scheme are developed.},

is the sum of finely-sampled squared return realizations over a fixed time interval. In a frictionless market the estimate

We begin with an account of how and why the procedure works in a simplified setting and then extend the discussion to a more
general framework. Along the way we clarify how the realized volatility and quadratic return variation relate to the more
commonly applied concept of conditional return variance. We then review a set of related and useful notions of return variation

existing empirical applications.},

The authors first show that an approach employing the Bayesian decision rule under a diffuse prior will always outperform the riskless/tangency portfolio.

To address this question, I derive explicit expressions for the statistical distribution of the Sharpe ratio using standard asymptotic theory under several sets of assumptions for the return-generating process--independently and identically distributed returns, stationary returns, and with time aggregation. I show that monthly Sharpe ratios cannot be annualized by multiplying by ‚àö12 except under very special circumstances, and I derive the correct method of conversion in the general case of stationary returns. In an illustrative empirical example of mutual funds and hedge funds, I find that the annual Sharpe ratio for a hedge fund can be overstated by as much as 65 percent because of the presence of serial correlation in monthly returns, and once this serial correlation is properly taken into account, the rankings of hedge funds based on Sharpe ratios can change dramatically.},

We find evidence that four separate regimes - characterized as crash, slow growth, bull and recovery states - are required to capture the joint distribution of stock and bond returns. Optimal asset allocations vary considerably across these states and change over time as investors revise their estimates of the state probabilities. In the crash state, buy-and-hold investors allocate more of their portfolio to stocks the longer their investment horizon, while the optimal allocation to stocks declines as a function of the investment horizon in bull markets. The joint effects of learning about state probabilities and predictability of asset returns from the dividend yield give rise to a non-monotonic relationship between the investment horizon and the demand for stocks. Out-of-sample forecasting experiments confirm the economic importance of accounting for the presence of regimes in asset returns.},

First, the asymptotic behavior of the tails of the marginal distribution is described for the two cases when the noise distribution

from a stochastic volatility process, converges in distribution to a Poisson process. From the point process convergence,
a variety of limit results for extremes can be derived. Of special note, there is no extremal clustering for stochastic volatility
processes in both the light- and heavy-tailed cases. This property is in sharp contrast with {GARCH} processes which exhibit
extremal clustering (i.e., large values of the process come in clusters).},

Correlations, as typically measured over the full sample of returns, often belie an asset's diversification properties in market environments when diversification is most needed. Moreover, upside diversification is undesirable. The authors first describe the mathematics of conditional correlations assuming returns are normally distributed. Then they present empirical results across a wide variety of assets, which reveal that, unlike the theoretical conditional correlations, empirical correlations are significantly asymmetric. Finally, the authors show that a portfolio construction technique called full-scale optimization produces portfolios in which the component assets exhibit relatively lower correlations on the downside and higher correlations on the upside than mean-variance optimization portfolios. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

Nevertheless, {MV} optimization is superior to many ad hoc techniques in terms of integration of portfolio objectives with client constraints and efficient use of information.

In this paper we examine the relation between correlation and variance in a conditional time and state varying framework. We use a switching {ARCH} {(SWARCH)} technique that does two things. One, it enables us to model variance as state varying. Two, a bivariate {SWARCH} model allows us to go from conditional variance to state varying covariances and correlations and hence test for differences in correlations across variance regimes. We find that the correlations between the {U.S.} and other world markets are on average 2 to 3.5 times higher when the {U.S.} market is in a high variance state as compared to a low variance regime. We also find that, compared to a {GARCH} framework, the portfolio choices resulting from our {SWARCH} model lead to higher Sharpe ratios.},

But this essentially assumes that a serious loss, which develops during the holding period, will be ignored until the terminal date. A more relevant measure of risk exposure for an investor may be the probability that a loss of a given magnitude will develop at any time over the horizon. As Kritzman, Lowry, and Vanroyen show, these probabilities can be substantially larger than the point probabilities as of maturity day. A second property of the asset returns process that can induce incorrect risk assessments is the possibility that there are multiple regimes, e.g., calm periods and turbulent periods. Treating a historical sample of returns as if there were only one regime leads to underestimating exposure when one is in the turbulent period. This article presents useful and practical techniques for handling both of these problems, along with simulation results to show how much difference they can make in a practical setting.‚Äù},

We find similar results for synthetic share prices of hard-to-borrow stocks, suggesting that the dislocation in actual and synthetic share prices is attributable to the increased hedging costs for options on banned stocks during the short sale ban.},

This paper provides a Bayesian framework for making portfolio decisions that takes this regime switching into account, together with asset pricing model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. The findings reveal that the economic value of accounting for regimes is substantially independent of whether or not model and parameter uncertainties are incorporated: the certainty-equivalent losses associated with ignoring regime switching are generally above 2\% per year and can be as high as 10\%. These results suggest that the more realistic regime switching model is fundamentally different from the commonly used single-state model, and hence should be employed instead in portfolio decisions irrespective of concerns about model or parameter uncertainty.},

We show that the probability of the joint occurrence of extreme stock returns may be higher for asymmetric thresholds than for symmetric thresholds. We propose a non-parametric measure of extreme dependence which allows capturing extreme events for different thresholds and can be used to compute different types of extreme dependence. We find that extreme dependence among the stock markets of ten initial {EMU} member countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States is largely asymmetrical in the {pre-EMU} period (1989--1998) and largely symmetrical in the {EMU} period (1999--2010). Our findings suggest that ignoring the possibility of asymmetric extreme dependence may lead to an underestimation of the probability of co-booms and co-crashes.},

We show that for normally distributed returns and ‚Äònon-informative‚Äô or ‚Äòinvariant‚Äô priors, the admissible set of portfolios taking the estimation uncertainty into account is identical to that given by traditional analysis. However, as a result of estimation risk, the optimal portfolio choice differs from that obtained by traditional analysis.

They also use their framework to propose several new portfolio strategies. For the proposed portfolios, they provide a moment-shrinkage interpretation and a Bayesian interpretation where the investor has a prior belief on portfolio weights rather than on moments of asset returns. Finally, they compare empirically the out-of-sample performance of the new portfolios they propose to 10 strategies in the literature across five data sets. They find that the norm-constrained portfolios often have a higher Sharpe ratio than the portfolio strategies in Jagannathan and Ma (2003), Ledoit and Wolf (2003, 2004), the {1/N} portfolio, and other strategies in the literature, such as factor portfolios.},

In order to provide a general framework being able to accommodate skewness, leptokurtosis, fat tails as well as the time-varying volatility that are often found in financial data, generalized hyperbolic {(GH)} distribution is used for innovations. As the association between the underlying assets may vary over time, the dynamic copula approach is considered. Therefore, the proposed method proves to play an important role in pricing bivariate option. The approach is illustrated for Chinese market with one type of better-of-two markets claims: call option on the better performer of Shanghai Stock Composite Index and Shenzhen Stock Composite Index. Results show that the option prices obtained by the {GARCH-GH} model with time-varying copula differ substantially from the prices implied by the {GARCH-Gaussian} dynamic copula model. Moreover, the empirical work displays the advantage of the suggested method.},

To calculate the optimal mean-variance portfolio weights, one needs to estimate for each stock its volatility, correlations with all other stocks, and expected return. Our empirical evidence shows that, while using the option-implied volatilities and correlations does not improve significantly the portfolio variance, Sharpe ratio, and certainty-equivalent return, exploiting information about expected returns that is contained in the volatility risk premium and option-implied skewness increases substantially Sharpe ratios and certainty-equivalent returns, but this is accompanied by higher portfolio turnover.},

	abstract = {In spite of theoretical benefits, Markowitz mean-variance {(MV)} optimized portfolios often fail to meet practical investment goals of marketability, usability, and performance, prompting many investors to seek simpler alternatives. Financial experts Richard and Robert Michaud demonstrate that the limitations of {MV} optimization are not the result of conceptual flaws in Markowitz theory but unrealistic representation of investment information. What is missing is a realistic treatment of estimation error in the optimization and rebalancing process. The text provides a non-technical review of classical Markowitz optimization and traditional objections. The authors demonstrate that in practice the single most important limitation of {MV} optimization is oversensitivity to estimation error. Portfolio optimization requires a modern statistical perspective. Efficient Asset Management, Second Edition uses Monte Carlo resampling to address information uncertainty and define Resampled {Efficiency(TM)} {(RE)} technology. {RE} optimized portfolios represent a new definition of portfolio optimality that is more investment intuitive, robust, and provably investment effective. {RE} rebalancing provides the first rigorous portfolio trading, monitoring, and asset importance rules, avoiding widespread ad hoc methods in current practice. The Second Edition resolves several open issues and misunderstandings that have emerged since the original edition. The new edition includes new proofs of effectiveness, substantial revisions of statistical estimation, extensive discussion of long-short optimization, and new tools for dealing with estimation error in applications and enhancing computational efficiency. {RE} optimization is shown to be a Bayesian-based generalization and enhancement of Markowitz's solution. {RE} technology corrects many current practices that may adversely impact the investment value of trillions of dollars under current asset management. {RE} optimization technology may also be useful in other financial optimizations and more generally in multivariate estimation contexts of information uncertainty with Bayesian linear constraints. Michaud and Michaud's new book includes numerous additional proposals to enhance investment value including Stein and Bayesian methods for improved input estimation, the use of portfolio priors, and an economic perspective for asset-liability optimization. Applications include investment policy, asset allocation, and equity portfolio optimization. A final chapter includes practical advice for avoiding simple portfolio design errors. A simple global asset allocation problem illustrates portfolio optimization techniques. The presentation is intuitive, rigorous and informed with institutional management experience to appeal to investment management executives, consultants, fund trustees, brokers, academics, and anyone seeking to stay abreast of the future of investment technology. With its important implications for investment practice, Efficient Asset Management's highly intuitive yet rigorous approach to defining optimal portfolios will appeal to investment management executives, consultants, brokers, and anyone seeking to stay abreast of current investment technology. Through practical examples and illustrations, Michaud and Michaud update the practice of optimization for modern investment management.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the possible uses of the Generalized Method of Moments {(GMM)} to estimate Stochastic Volatility {(SV)} models.
A primary attraction of the method of moments technique is that it is well suited for identifying and estimating volatility
models without a complete parametric specification of the probability distributions. Moreover, simulation-based methods of
moments are able to exploit a variety of moments, while avoiding limitations due to a lack of closed form expressions. The
chapter first highlights the suitability of {GMM} for popular regression models of volatility forecasting. Then, it reviews
the implications of the {SV} model specification in terms of higher order moments: skewness, kurtosis, variance of the variance,
leverage and feedback effects. The chapter examines the ability of a continuous time version of {SV} models to accommodate data
from other sources like option prices or high frequency data on returns and transactions dates. Simulation-based methods are
particularly useful for studying continuous time models due to the frequent lack of closed form expressions for their discrete
time dynamics. These simulation-based methods of moments are presented within the unifying framework of indirect inference
with a special emphasis on misspecification. Likely misspecification of the parametric model used for simulation requires
a parsimonious and well-focused choice of the moments to match.},

These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. {GARCH} models rule this out by assumption. (ii) {GARCH} models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in {GARCH} models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of {ARCH} is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the {CRSP} {Value-Weighted} Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

We provide a unified framework to simultaneously investigate asymmetric volatility at the firm and the market level and to examine two potential explanations of the asymmetry: leverage effects and volatility feedback. Our empirical application uses the market portfolio and portfolios with different leverage constructed from Nikkei 225 stocks. We reject the pure leverage model of Christie (1982) and find support for a volatility feedback story. Volatility feedback at the firm level is enhanced by strong asymmetries in conditional covariances. Conditional betas do not show significant asymmetries. We document the risk premium implications of these findings.},

Then we run simulation experiments to study properties of the optimal {LA} and {MV} portfolios under more realistic assumptions. We find that under asymmetric dependence {LA} portfolios outperform {MV} portfolios, provided investors are sufficiently loss-averse and dependence is large. Finally, using 13 {EU} and {US} assets, we implement the trading strategy of a linear {LA} investor who reallocates his/her portfolio on a monthly basis. We find that {LA} portfolios clearly outperform {MV} and {CVaR} portfolios and that incorporating a dynamic update of the {LA} parameters significantly improves the performance of {LA} portfolios.},

The copula fitting results for daily cumulative returns between the Swiss Market Index and a stock in the index family for an approximate 1-year period are quite satisfactory.

Our approach is based on the computation - over both a test and a benchmark period - of the conditional probability that a random variable yt is lower than a given quantile, when the other random variable xt is also lower than its corresponding quantile, for any set of prespecified quantiles. Time-varying conditional quantiles are modeled via regression quantiles. The conditional probability is estimated through a simple {OLS} regression. We illustrate the methodology by investigating the impact of the crises of the 1990s on the major Latin American equity markets returns. Our results document significant increases in equity return co-movements during crises consistent with the presence of financial contagion.},

Assuming normally distributed marginal returns, we illustrate how asymmetric return correlations affect the efficient frontier and subsequent portfolio performance under a dynamic rebalancing framework. Implementing this methodology within the context of tactically allocating a small set of market indices, we demonstrate several key findings. First, we establish the manner by which the efficient frontier constructed under asymmetric dependence differs from a mean-variance frontier. By establishing a paper portfolio based on these differences, we find that asymmetric correlation structures do have real economic value. The primary source of this economic value is the ability to better protect portfolio value and reduce the size of any erosion in return relative to the normal portfolio when asymmetric return correlations are accounted for.},

The results indicate very little downside risk in East Asia. Third, East Asian and Latin American returns exhibit some correlation complexity. Interestingly, the regions with maximal dependence or worst diversification do not command large returns. Our results suggest international limits to diversification.

We argue that the extreme weightings in sample efficient portfolios are due to the dominance of a single factor in equity returns. This makes it easy to diversify on subsets to reduce residual risk, while weighting the subsets to reduce factor risk simultaneously. The latter involves taking extreme positions. This behavior seems unlikely to be attributable to sampling error.},

Specifically, hedge funds seem more inclined to produce return distributions with significantly non-normal skewness and kurtosis. There is also growing acceptance of the notion that investor preferences are better represented by bilinear utility functions or S-shaped value functions than by neo-classical utility functions such as power utility. Many investors have therefore concluded that mean-variance optimization is not appropriate for forming portfolios that include hedge funds. We apply both mean-variance optimization and full-scale optimization to form portfolios of hedge funds, given a wide range of assumptions about investor preferences. We find that higher moments of hedge funds do not meaningfully compromise the efficacy of mean-variance optimization if investors have power utility. We also find, however, that mean-variance optimization is not particularly effective for identifying optimal hedge fund allocations if preferences are bilinear or S-shaped. Finally, we show that investors with bilinear utility dislike kurtosis and that, contrary to conventional wisdom, investors with S-shaped preferences are attracted to kurtosis as well as negative skewness. Mean-variance optimization is insensitive to these preferences.},

Moreover, we check the stability of the copula parameter. The empirical results show that the long memory affects the dependence structure. Second, we analyze the impact of this dependence structure on the optimal portfolio. We propose a new approach based on minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk and assuming that the dependence structure is modeled by the copula parameter.

economic idea that the risk of correlation changes (affecting diversification benefits and investment
opportunities) may be priced. We propose a powerful test by comparing option-implied
correlations between stock returns (obtained by combining {S\&P100} option prices with prices
of individual options on all index components) with realized correlations. Our parsimonious
model shows that the substantial gap between average implied (46.7\%) and realized (28.7\%)
correlations is direct evidence of a large negative correlation risk premium, since individual
variance risk is not priced in our 1996-2003 sample. Empirical implementation of our model
also indicates that the entire index variance risk premium can be attributed to the high price
of correlation risk. Finally, the model offers a quantitatively accurate risk-based explanation
of the empirically observed discrepancy between expected returns on index and on individual
options. Index options are expensive, in contrast to individual options, because they hedge
correlation risk. Standard models for individual equity returns with priced jump},

This article extends the existing literature, which has mostly focused on the covariance matrix, by introducing improved estimators for the coskewness and cokurtosis parameters. We find that the use of these enhanced estimates generates a significant improvement in investors' welfare.

Using data on sixteen national stock markets, we estimate a multivariate factor model in which the volatility of returns is induced by changing volatility in the factors. Unanticipated returns are assumed to depend both on innovations in "observable" economic variables and on "unobservable" factors. The risk premium on an asset is a linear combination of the risk premia associated with factors. We find that idiosyncratic risk is significantly priced, and that the "price of risk" is not common across countries. This either can be interpreted as evidence against the null of integrated capital markets or could reflect the failure of some other maintained assumptions. Another empirical finding is that only a small proportion of the covariances between national stock markets and their time-variation can be accounted for by "observable" economic variables. Changes in correlations between markets are driven primarily by movements in "unobservable" variables.},

Contagion is defined independently of changes in macroeconomic fundamentals.

In the study reported here, I attempted to measure contagion from daily cross-border portfolio flows. Using data from State Street Bank and Trust Company, I constructed three indexes for 1996 through 2000. I found little statistical evidence of contagion, but the weighted index that measured the "contagiousness" of flows reached its four-year low in August 1998, suggesting that the Russian crisis was characterized by both contagion and large aggregate outflows. I also found that contagion appears to be regional and that the developed countries seem to be sheltered from contagion.},

In addition, international correlation increases in periods of high market volatility. Although the correlation of individual foreign stock markets with the {U.S.} stock market has generally increased slightly over the past 37 years, it has not increased during the past 10 years. Similarly, the international correlation of bond markets increased in the early 1980s, but it has had no discernible trend in the past 10 years. The fairly low levels of international correlation among stocks or bonds suggests that national factors still strongly affect local asset prices. The link between correlation and market volatility is bad news for global money managers because when the domestic market is subject to a strong negative shock is when the benefits of international risk diversification are needed most.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for optimal portfolio selection using a Bayesian decision theoretic framework that addresses two major shortcomings of the traditional Markowitz approach: the ability to handle higher moments and parameter uncertainty. We employ the skew normal distribution which has many attractive features for modeling multivariate returns. Our results suggest that it is important to incorporate higher order moments in portfolio selection. Further, our comparison to other methods where parameter uncertainty is either ignored or accommodated in an ad hoc way, shows that our approach leads to higher expected utility than competing methods, such as the resampling methods that are common in the practice of finance.},

We use the pair-copula decomposition of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge data sets automatically.},

In statistics, extremes of a random process refer to the lowest observation (the minimum) and to the highest observation (the maximum) over a given time-period. Extreme value theory gives some interesting results about the distribution of extreme returns. In particular, the limiting distribution of extreme returns observed over a long time-period is largely independent of the distribution of returns itself. In financial markets, extreme price movements correspond to market corrections during ordinary periods, and also to stock market crashes, bond market collapses or foreign exchange crises during extraordinary periods. An approach based on extreme values to compute the {VaR} thus covers market conditions ranging from the usual environment considered by the existing {VaR} methods to the financial crises which are the focus of stress testing. Univariate extreme value theory is used to compute the {VaR} of a fully aggregated position while multivariate extreme value theory is used to compute the {VaR} of a position decomposed on risk factors.},

The optimal strategy is characterized by two principles: (1) aim in front of the target, and (2) trade partially toward the current aim. Specifically, the optimal updated portfolio is a linear combination of the existing portfolio and an ìaim portfolio,î which is a weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the moving target) and the expected Markowitz portfolios on all future dates (where the target is moving). Intuitively, predictors with slower mean-reversion (alpha decay) get more weight in the aim portfolio.

	abstract = {Daily change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ({DJIA}) is a biased and imprecise measure of actual change in the {US} stock market, whether measured as capital appreciation or total return, despite high correlations with other market indexes. Because it omits cash dividends, the Dow underestimates daily market total return. This paper shows, however, that the index also understates daily market capital appreciation because it is less diversified than the market. Specifically, the Dow is a large-cap index, so it underperforms the {US} market over the long run owing to the small-stock risk premium. The {DJIA} overstates daily volatility primarily because the index is less diversified than the market and thus has a significant diversifiable component to its risk. Furthermore, large daily volatility makes the {DJIA} a poor tool for drawing inferences about actual daily change in either {US} or international stock markets. Given an observed daily change in the Dow, confidence intervals for the market return can be constructed, but these intervals may prove too wide to provide much information.Journal of Asset Management (2003) 4, 258ñ276; doi:10.1057/palgrave.jam.2240107},

(ii) {GARCH} models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in {GARCH} models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree.

To address this problem, we introduce a procedure for identifying multivariate outliers and use the outliers to estimate a new covariance matrix. We suggest that a covariance matrix estimated from outliers characterizes a portfolio's riskiness during market turbulence better than a full-sample covariance matrix. We also introduce a procedure for blending an inside-sample covariance matrix with one from an outlier sample. This procedure enables one to express views about the likelihood of each risk regime and to differentiate one's aversion to them. Our framework collapses to the Markowitz mean-variance model if (1) we set the probabilities of the inside and outlying covariance matrixes equal to their empirical frequencies, (2) we are equally averse to both risk regimes, and (3) we estimate the inside and outlying covariances around the full sample's mean.},

	abstract = {This paper examines execution costs and the impact of trade size for stock index futures using price-volume transaction data from the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Consistent with Subrahmanyam [Rev. Financ. Stud. 4 (1991) 17] we find that effective half spreads in the stock index futures market are small compared to stock markets, and that trades in stock index futures have only a small permanent price impact. This result is important as it helps to better understand the success of equity index products such as index futures and Exchange Traded Funds. We also find that there is no asymmetry in the post-trade price reaction between purchases and sales for stock index futures across various trade sizes. This result is consistent with the conjecture in Chan and Lakonishok [J. Financ. Econ. 33 (1993) 173] that the asymmetry surrounding block trades in stock markets is due to the high cost of short selling and the general reluctance of traders to short sell on stock markets.},

The models illuminate patterns of asymmetric mean reversion and risk decimation. Between 1926:01 and l997:12, not only did negative returns reverse to positive returns quicker than positive returns reverted to negative ones, but negative returns, in fact, reduced risk premiums from predictable high volatility. The findings support the market overreaction hypotheses. The asymmetry is due to the mispricing behavior on the part of investors who overreact to certain market news.

However, standard deviation loses the explanatory power once the other explanatory variables are included in the hazard model. Further, we find that liquidation does not necessarily mean failure in the hedge fund industry. By reexamining the attrition rate, we show that the real failure rate of 3.1\% is lower than the attrition rate of 8.7\% on an annual basis during the period of 1995--2004.},

We explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are wrong.

The dependence is modeled with a dynamic canonical vine copula, which can be decomposed into a cascade of bivariate conditional copulas. Due to this decomposition, the model does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The canonical vine autoregressive {(CAVA)} captures asymmetries in the dependence structure. The model is applied to 95 {S\&P500} stocks. For the marginal distributions, we use {non-Gaussian} {GARCH} models, that are designed to capture skewness and kurtosis. By conditioning on the market index and on sector indexes, the dependence structure is much simplified and the model can be considered as a non-linear version of the {CAPM} or of a market model with sector effects. The model is shown to deliver good forecasts of {Value-at-Risk.}},

For example, investors who desire to increase positive skewness would hold a less diversified portfolio, while those who care more about extreme losses would hold a more diversified portfolio. Experimenting with a more general pool of stocks yields the same conclusions.},

This is typically the situation for portfolios including derivatives. In this case, it can be necessary to come back to the basic expected utility approach. In this paper, an efficient portfolio maximizes the expected utility of future wealth. This paper presents an analysis of the efficiency frontier, formed by a set of efficient portfolios corresponding to a parameterized class of utility functions. First, we discuss the estimation of an efficient portfolio and introduce several tests of the efficiency hypothesis, depending on what is known about the utility function and the budget level. Next we analyse the shape of the frontier and develop a procedure for testing the separability of the efficiency frontier into K independent funds. The inference is semi-nonparametric because the return distribution is left unspecified. We illustrate our approach by an application to portfolios including derivatives.},

Theoretically, it is shown that the level of acceptability varies directly with the amount of stress tolerated. In an empirical application, the performance measures are applied to cash flows generated by writing options on the {SPX} and the {FTSE.} This exercise reveals that acceptability levels are U-shaped in the strike direction.},

This article provides models of asset returns that match these patterns and illustrates their use in asset allocation. The presence of regimes with different correlations and expected returns is difficult to exploit within a framework focused on global equities. Nevertheless, for global all-equity portfolios, the regime-switching strategy dominated static strategies in an out-of-sample test. In addition, substantial value was added when an investor switched between domestic cash, bonds, and equity investments. In a persistent high-volatility market, the model told the investor to switch primarily to cash. Large market-timing benefits are possible because high-volatility regimes tend to coincide with periods of relatively high interest rates.},

In this paper, we show the importance of selecting an accurate copula for risk management. We extend standard goodness-of-fit tests to copulas. Contrary to existing, indirect tests, these tests can be applied to any copula of any dimension and are based on a direct comparison of a given copula with observed data. For a portfolio consisting of stocks, bonds and real estate, these tests provide clear evidence in favor of the Student‚Äôs t copula, and reject both the correlation-based Gaussian copula and the extreme value-based Gumbel copula. In comparison with the Student‚Äôs t copula, we find that the Gaussian copula underestimates the probability of joint extreme downward movements, while the Gumbel copula overestimates this risk. Similarly we establish that the Gaussian copula is too optimistic on diversification benefits, while the Gumbel copula is too pessimistic. Moreover, these differences are significant.},

	abstract = {per we address the issue of modeling extreme asset co-movements and their implications for the hedging demands of a dynamic portfolio. We propose a model that is able to accommodate an extremal dependence structure through the stationary distribution of the state variables underlying the asset price process, as well as through a dynamic conditional correlation specification, driven by latent and observable factors. With this we aim at replicating the stylized fact of increased dependence during extreme market downturns, rising market-wide volatility, or worsening macroeconomic conditions. The model we propose accounts for stylized properties of asset returns in terms of univariate tail behavior as well as varying forms of dependence in the extremes , while keeping a continuous time complete market setup for a tractable portfolio solution. The paper further concentrates on the portfolio implications of those stylized facts. We isolate the intertemporal hedging demands, including those for correlation risk due to stochastic changes in the factors. Thus, we are able to analyze separately the impact of tail dependence through the unconditional distribution of the underlying state variables and that of conditional correlation on the portfolio holdings. We find that both correlation hedging demands and intertemporal hedges due to increased tail dependence have distinct portfolio implications and cannot act as substitutes to each other. As well, there are substantial economic costs for disregarding both the dynamics of conditional correlation and the dependence in the extremes.},

	abstract = {The popularity of downside risk among investors is growing and mean return-downside risk portfolio selection models seem to oppress the familiar mean-variance approach. The reason for the success of the former models is that they separate return fluctuations into downside risk and upside potential. This is especially relevant for asymmetrical return distributions, for which mean-variance models punish the upside potential in the same fashion as the downside risk.
The paper focuses on the differences and similarities between using variance or a downside risk measure, both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. We first discuss the theoretical properties of different downside risk measures and the corresponding mean-downside risk models. Against common beliefs, we show that from the large family of downside risk measures, only a few possess better theoretical properties within a return-risk framework than the variance. On the empirical side, we analyze the differences between some {US} asset allocation portfolios based on variances and downside risk measures. Among other things, we find that the downside risk approach tends to produce - on average - slightly higher bond allocations than the mean-variance approach. Furthermore, we take a closer look at estimation risk, viz. the effect of sampling error in expected returns and risk measures on portfolio composition. On the basis of simulation analyses, we find that there are marked differences in the degree of estimation accuracy, which calls for further research.},

We apply the model to returns from the G5 and Latin American regions, and document three main findings. First, we discover that models with canonical vines generally dominate alternative dependence structures. Second, the choice of copula is important for risk management, since it modifies the {Value-at-Risk} {(VaR)} of international portfolios and produces a better out-of-sample performance.

By shrinking the sample averages toward a common mean, I find that the out-of-sample performance of the optimal portfolio is substantially increased.

Today's investors note the high correlations between {U.S.} and international stocks and doubt the benefits of global diversification. We argue that the benefits of global diversification remain high and that the correlation between {U.S.} and international stocks is a misleading measure of the benefits of global diversification. This is for two reasons. First, the benefits of global diversification depend not only on the correlation between the returns of {U.S.} and international stocks but also on the standard deviations of these returns. Second, we tend to have poor intuition about the link between correlation and the benefits of diversification. A 0.86 correlation seems high enough to eliminate the benefits of diversification, but even correlations much higher than 0.86 are associated with substantial benefits. Dispersion of returns is a better measure of the benefits of diversification because it accounts for the effects of both correlation and standard deviation and because it provides an intuitive measure of the benefits of diversification. We present the relationship between correlation, standard deviation and dispersion.},

In the context of managing downside correlations, we examine the use of multi-dimensional elliptical and asymmetric copula models to forecast returns for portfolios with 3ñ12 constituents. Our analysis assumes that investors have no short-sales constraints and a utility function characterized by the minimization of Conditional Value-at-Risk ({CVaR).} We examine the efficient frontiers produced by each model and focus on comparing two methods for incorporating scalable asymmetric dependence structures across asset returns using the Archimedean Clayton copula in an out-of-sample, long-run multi-period setting. For portfolios of higher dimensions, we find that modeling asymmetries within the marginals and the dependence structure with the Clayton canonical vine copula ({CVC)} consistently produces the highest-ranked outcomes across a range of statistical and economic metrics when compared to other models incorporating elliptical or symmetric dependence structures. Accordingly, we conclude that {CVC} copulas are ëworth ití when managing larger portfolios.},

We make several contributions in this field. First, we propose two novel calibration criteria for the vector of means and the inverse covariance matrix. Second, for the covariance matrix we propose a novel calibration criterion that takes the condition number optimally into account. Third, for shrinkage portfolios we study two novel calibration criteria. Fourth, we propose a simple multivariate smoothed bootstrap approach to construct the optimal shrinkage intensity. Finally, we carry out an extensive out-of-sample analysis with simulated and empirical datasets, and we characterize the performance of the different shrinkage estimators for portfolio selection.},

Consequently, a {CVaR} constraint is more effective than a {VaR} constraint as a tool to control slightly risk-averse agents, but in the absence of a risk-free security, has a perverse effect in that it is more likely to force highly risk-averse agents to select portfolios with larger standard deviations. However, when the {CVaR} bound is appropriately larger than the {VaR} bound or when a risk-free security is present, a {CVaR} constraint "dominates" a {VaR} constraint as a risk management tool.},

Rather than first model the return distribution and subsequently characterize the portfolio choice, we determine directly the dependence of the optimal portfolio weights on the predictive variables. We combine the predictors into a single index that best captures time variations in investment opportunities. This index helps investors determine which economic variables they should track and, more importantly, in what combination. We consider investors with both expected utility (mean variance and {CRRA)} and nonexpected utility (ambiguity aversion and prospect theory) objectives and characterize their market timing, horizon effects, and hedging demands.},

The theoretical basis of the {BLM} is Bayesian learning.

In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of the naive {1/N} rule with one of the four sophisticated strategies‚Äîthe Markowitz rule, the Jorion (1986) rule, the {MacKinlay} and P√°stor (2000) rule, and the Kan and Zhou (2007) rule‚Äîas a way to improve performance. We find that the combined rules not only have a significant impact in improving the sophisticated strategies, but also outperform the {1/N} rule in most scenarios. Since the combinations are theory-based, our study may be interpreted as reaffirming the usefulness of the Markowitz theory in practice.},

With a statistical methodology, we further relate the {œâ-Score} to readily available information such as fund performance, volatility, size, age, and fee structures. Finally, we demonstrate that while operational risk is more significant than financial risk in explaining fund failure, there is a significant and positive interaction between operational risk and financial risk. This is consistent with rogue trading anecdotes that suggest that fund failure associated with excessive risk taking occurs when operational controls and oversight are weak.},

	lccn = {0231},
	abstract = {Recent studies in the empirical finance literature have reported evidence of two types of asymmetries in the joint distribution of stock returns. The first is skewness in the distribution of individual stock returns. The second is an asymmetry in the dependence between stocks: stock returns appear to be more highly correlated during market downturns than during market upturns. In this article we examine the economic and statistical significance of these asymmetries for asset allocation decisions in an out-of-sample setting. We consider the problem of a constant relative risk aversion {(CRRA)} investor allocating wealth between the risk-free asset, a small-cap portfolio, and a large-cap portfolio. We use models that can capture time-varying moments up to the fourth order, and we use copula theory to construct models of the time-varying dependence structure that allow for different dependence during bear markets than bull markets. The importance of these two asymmetries for asset allocation is assessed by comparing the performance of a portfolio based on a normal distribution model with a portfolio based on a more flexible distribution model. For investors with no short-sales constraints, we find that knowledge of higher moments and asymmetric dependence leads to gains that are economically significant and statistically significant in some cases. For short sales-constrained investors the gains are limited.},

	title = {Dependence Structure and Extreme Comovements in International Equity and Bond Markets with Portfolio Diversification Effects},
	lccn = {0011},
	abstract = {urns are more dependent in bear markets than in bull markets. Previous studies have argued that a multivariate {GARCH} model or a regime switching {(RS)} model based on normal innovations could reproduce this asymmetric extreme dependence. We show analytically that it cannot be the case. We propose an alternative model that allows for tail dependence in lower returns and keeps tail independence for upper returns. This model is applied to international equity and bond markets to investigate their dependence structure. It includes one normal regime in which dependence is symmetric and a second regime characterized by a symmetric dependence. Empirical results show that the dependence between equities and bonds is low even in the same country, while the dependence between international assets of the same type is large in both regimes. The cross-country dependence is especially large in the asymmetric regime. Exchange rate volatility seems to be a factor contributing to asymmetric dependence. With the introduction of a fixed exchange rate the dependence between France and Germany becomes less asymmetric and more normal than before. High exchange rate volatility is associated with a high level of asymmetry. Empirical phenomena such as home bias investment and flight to safety are amplified by asymmetric dependence through coskewness. For a {US} investor who holds {US} and Canadian bonds and equities, the share invested in Canada increases with the asymmetric dependence since the Canadian market in our sample is less risky. However, when the adjustment for perceived risk is made to take into account the asymmetric information the result changes and asymmetric dependence increases the home investment. A similar behavior is observed for the bond and equity trade-off. In the asymmetric dependence regime, the very risk-averse agent increases the fraction of its wealth in bonds.},

	abstract = {We study a discrete-time version of Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problem where the market parameters depend on the market mode (regime) that jumps among a finite number of states. The random regime switching is delineated by a finite-state Markov chain, based on which a discrete-time Markov modulated portfolio selection model is presented. Such models either arise from multiperiod portfolio selections or result from numerical solution of continuous-time problems. The natural connections between discrete-time models and their continuous-time counterpart are revealed. Since the Markov chain frequently has a large state space, to reduce the complexity, an aggregated process with smaller state-space is introduced and the underlying portfolio selection is formulated as a two-time-scale problem. We prove that the process of interest yields a switching diffusion limit using weak convergence methods. Next, based on the optimal control of the limit process obtained from our recent work, we devise portfolio selection strategies for the original problem and demonstrate their asymptotic optimality.},

	abstract = {We consider the extreme value theory for a stationary {GARCH} process with iid innovations. One of the basic ingredients of
this theory is the fact that, under general conditions, {GARCH} processes have power law marginal tails and, more generally,
regularly varying finite-dimensional distributions. Distributions with power law tails combined with weak dependence conditions
imply that the scaled maxima of a {GARCH} process converge in distribution to a Fr√©chet distribution. The dependence structure
of a {GARCH} process is responsible for the clustering of exceedances of a {GARCH} process above high and low level exceedances.
The size of these clusters can be described by the extremal index. We also consider the convergence of the point processes
of exceedances of a {GARCH} process toward a point process whose Laplace functional can be expressed explicitly in terms of
the intensity measure of a Poisson process and a cluster distribution.},

	lccn = {0085},
	abstract = {{THE} {USE} {OF} mean-variance analysis in portfolio selection involves the estima- tion of means, variances, and covariances for the returns of all securities under consideration. Typically the estimates of those parameters are used as if they were the "true" (i.e., known) parameter values. Kalymon [3] has recently indicated the effects of uncertainty about means upon the investor's prob- ability distribution of future security returns. The estimation of the covariance matrix is a more difficult task than the estimation of the mean vector, however, so uncertainty about the covariance matrix may be greater and may therefore have a stronger impact upon the investor's probability distribution of future security returns than has uncertainty about the mean vector. In Section One of the paper the effects of three contrasting assumptions about prior knowledge of the parameters of the distribution of future security returns upon the investor's subjective probability distribution of security re- turns are considered. The effects of these assumptions upon estimates of portfolio risk are described, and a comparison is made of portfolio risk in the three cases. In Section Two it is shown that the set of efficient portfolios does not change as the assumptions of knowledge about ,t and z change, i.e., the efficient set consists of the same portfolios in all three cases. In Section Three it is shown that although the efficient set does not change as additional uncertainty is considered, the portfolio which would be selected from among those in the efficient set does change, and the type of change that occurs is an intuitively reasonable one. Finally, a summary and discussion is presented in Section Four.},

In conducting an empirical study based on return data of 2763 hedge funds, we compare the Sharpe ratio with 12 other performance measures. Despite significant deviations of hedge fund returns from a normal distribution, our comparison of the Sharpe ratio to the other performance measures results in virtually identical rank ordering across hedge funds.},

These results are used to obtain root-n consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of important features of the transition distribution such as the (nonlinear) conditional moments and conditional quantiles.

Depending on the reinsurance contract and the copula concept employed, we find large differences in risk assessment for the ruin probability and for the expected policyholder deficit. This has important implications for management decisions, as well as for regulators and rating agencies that use these risk measures for deriving capital standards and ratings.},

We also test the relevance of the dependence specification over both volatile and quiet market scenarios.

However, the dependence function becomes more relevant in particularly volatile market conditions.},

	abstract = {When portfolio optimization is implemented using the historical characteristics of security returns, estimation error can degrade the desirable properties of the investment portfolio that is selected. Given the problem of estimation risk, it is natural to formulate rules of portfolio selection within a Bayesian framework. In this framework, portfolio selection is based on maximization of expected utility conditioned on the predictive distribution of security returns. Most researchers have addressed the problem of estimation risk by asserting a noninformative diffuse prior that reduces the detrimental effect of estimation risk, but does not directly reduce estimation error. Portfolio performance can be improved by specifying an informative prior that reduces estimation error. An informative prior that all securities have identical expected returns, variances, and pairwise correlation coefficients is asserted. This informative prior reduces estimation error by drawing the posterior estimates of each security's expected return, variance, and pairwise correlation coefficients toward the average return, average variance, and average correlation coefficient, respectively, of all the securities in the population. The amount that each of these parameters is drawn toward its grand mean depends upon the degree to which the sample is consistent with the informative prior. This empirical Bayes method is shown to select portfolios whose performance is superior to that achieved, given the assumption of a noninformative prior or by using classical sample estimates.},

Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the {1/N} rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to the {US} equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the {1/N} benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

series expansions to more complex polynomial-based expansions and infill approximations to the likelihood based on a continuous
time data record. The methods are discussed, their properties are outlined and their relative finite sample performance compared
in a simulation experiment with the nonlinear {CIR} diffusion model, which is popular in empirical finance. Bias correction
methods are also considered and particular attention is given to jackknife and indirect inference estimators. The latter retains
the good asymptotic properties of {ML} estimation while removing finite sample bias. This method demonstrates superior performance

Almost immediately upon implementation, however, the portfolio's weights become sub-optimal as changes in asset prices cause the portfolio to drift away from the optimal targets. In an idealized world without transaction costs investors would rebalance continually to the optimal weights. In the presence of transaction costs investors must balance the cost of sub-optimality with the cost of restoring the optimal weights. We apply a quadratic heuristic to address the asset weight drift problem, and we compare it to a dynamic programming solution as well as to standard industry heuristics. Our tests reveal that the quadratic heuristic provides solutions that are remarkably close to the dynamic programming solutions for those cases in which dynamic programming is feasible and far superior to solutions based on standard industry heuristics. In the case of five assets, in fact, it performs better than dynamic programming due to approximations required to implement the dynamic programming algorithm. Moreover, unlike the dynamic programming solution, the quadratic heuristic is scalable to as many as several hundreds assets.},

This approach often yields implausible expectations.

Via {Monte-Carlo} simulations, we show that maximum-likelihood estimators are essentially unbiased, provided the size of subsamples is correctly chosen, and that the likelihood-ratio tests on parameters characterizing the behavior of extremes are correctly sized. For actual returns, we find that left and right tails behave very similarly. Across countries, we find that extremes are located at different levels and that their dispersion varies. The tail index, characterizing large extreme realizations, is found to be constant within each geographical group. We verify that the perception that left tails are heavier than right ones is not due to clustering of extremes. The failure to detect statistical significant differences is likely to be due to the relative infrequency of large extremes.},

A trading strategy exploiting priced correlation risk generates a high alpha and is attractive for {CRRA} investors without frictions.

	abstract = {A number of recent studies finds two asymmetries in dependence structures in international equity markets: specifically, dependence tends to be high in both highly volatile markets and in bear markets. In this paper, a further investigation of asymmetric dependence structures in international equity markets is performed by using the Markov switching model and copula theory. Combining these two theories enables me to model dependence structures with sufficient flexibility. Using this flexible framework, I indeed find that there are two distinct regimes in the {U.S.-U.K.} market. I also show that for the {U.S.-U.K.} market the bear regime is better described by an asymmetric copula with lower tail dependence with clear rejection of the Markov switching multivariate normal model. In addition. I show that ignorance of this further asymmetry in bear markets is very costly for risk management. Lastly, I conduct a similar analysis for other G7 countries, where I find other cases in which the use of a Markov switching multivariate normal model would be inappropriate. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

kernel smoothing are explained in the rather simple situation of density estimation and regression. For financial data, a
rather relevant topic is nonparametric estimation of a volatility function in a continuous-time model such as a homogeneous
diffusion model. We review results on nonparametric estimation for discretely observed processes, sampled at high or at low
frequency. We also discuss application of nonparametric methods to testing, especially model validation and goodness-of-fit
testing. In risk measurement for financial time series, conditional quantiles play an important role and nonparametric methods
have been successfully applied in this field too. At the end of the chapter we discuss Grenander‚Äôs sieve methods and other
more recent advanced nonparametric approaches.},

	abstract = {We present a recent innovation to portfolio construction called full-scale optimisation. In contrast to mean-variance analysis, which assumes that returns are normally distributed or that investors have quadratic utility, full-scale optimisation identifies the optimal portfolio given any set of return distributions and any description of investor preferences. It therefore yields the truly optimal portfolio in sample, whereas mean-variance analysis provides an approximation to the in-sample truth. Both approaches, however, suffer from estimation error. We employ a bootstrapping procedure to compare the estimation error of full-scale optimisation to the combined approximation and estimation error of mean-variance analysis. We find that, to a significant degree, the in-sample superiority of full-scale optimisation prevails out of sample. {[PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT]}},

We derive an alternative to previous estimators for implied correlation that is based on measures of portfolio downside risk and that does not suffer from bias. The unbiased quantile correlation estimates are directly applicable to portfolio optimization and to risk management techniques in general. This simple and practical method captures the increasing correlation in extreme market conditions while providing a pragmatic approach to understanding correlation structure in multivariate return distributions. Based on data for international equity markets, we found evidence of significant increased correlation in international equity returns in bear markets.

	abstract = {In this chapter, we build first a univariate and then a multivariate filtered historical simulation {(FHS)} model for financial
risk management. Both the univariate and multivariate methods simulate future returns from a model using historical return
innovations. While the former relies on portfolio returns filtered by a dynamic variance model, the latter uses individual
or base asset return innovations from dynamic variance and correlation models. The univariate model is suitable for passive
risk management or risk measurement whereas the multivariate model is useful for active risk management such as optimal portfolio
allocation. Both models are constructed in such a way as to capture the stylized facts in daily asset returns and to be simple
to estimate. The {FHS} approach enables the risk manager to easily compute {Value-at-Risk} and other risk measures including Expected
Shortfall for various investment horizons that are conditional on current market conditions. The chapter also lists various
alternatives to the suggested {FHS} approach.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes to estimate the covariance matrix of stock returns by an optimally weighted average of two existing estimators: the sample covariance matrix and single-index covariance matrix. This method is generally known as shrinkage, and it is standard in decision theory and in empirical Bayesian statistics. Our shrinkage estimator can be seen as a way to account for extra-market covariance without having to specify an arbitrary multifactor structure. For {NYSE} and {AMEX} stock returns from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with significantly lower out-of-sample variance than a set of existing estimators, including multifactor models.},
