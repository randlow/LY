We reveal that the turbulent year of 2008 has no significant effect on volatility levels of gold and silver however causes an upward shift in the volatility levels of palladium and platinum. Using the consistent dynamic conditional correlations, we show that precious metals get strongly correlated with each other in the last decade which reduces the diversification benefits across them and indicates a convergence to a single asset class. We endogenously detect the shifts in these dynamic correlation levels and reveal uni-directional volatility shift contagions among precious metals. The results show that gold has a uni-directional volatility shift contagion effect on all other precious metals and silver has a similar effect on platinum and palladium. However, the latter two do not matter in terms of volatility shift contagion. Thus, investors that hedge with precious metals should, in particular, monitor the volatility levels of gold and silver.},

In order to test the Baur and Lucey (2010) hypotheses, we contribute to the existing literature by the augmentation of their model to a smooth transition regression (STR) using an exponential transition function which splits the regression model into two extreme regimes. One accounts for periods in which stock returns are on average and therefore allows to test whether gold acts as a hedge for stocks, the other one accounts for periods characterized by extreme market conditions where the volatility of the stock returns is high. The latter state enables us to test whether gold can be regarded as a safe haven for stocks. The study includes a broad set of 18 individual markets as well as five regional indices and covers a sample period running from January 1970 to March 2012 on a monthly frequency. Overall, our findings show that gold serves as both a hedge and a safe haven. However, this ability seems to be market-specific. In addition, by applying a portfolio analysis we also show that our findings are useful for investors.},

To address the growing interest in diamonds, this article examines the historical performance of investments in various diamond quality grades.

Specifically, we focus on two important practical investment questions: Can diamonds function as a hedge or a safe haven against stock market volatility or fluctuations of the US dollar? Can diamonds be regarded as effective diversifiers in a stock or a currency portfolio context? Key findings are as follows: (1) The investment performance of diamonds is lower than the one of gold and silver. (2) Diamonds have only acted as a weak hedge and a weak safe haven against stock market downturns and currency risk associated with the US dollar. (3) Within global stock and currency portfolios, 1.0 carat fine diamonds show valuable diversification potential in that they can increase portfolio performance to an economically significant extent. Interestingly, this final result is fairly robust to the choice of performance measure.},
